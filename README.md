## Overview
The Task Management Application is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help users organize, prioritize, and track their tasks effectively. Built using React with Tailwind CSS for styling, this application enables users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on priority and completion status. Tasks are stored in local storage to persist between sessions, ensuring users donâ€™t lose their data on page refresh.
