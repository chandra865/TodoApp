# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<<<<<Task Management Application
Overview
The Task Management Application is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help users organize, prioritize, and track their tasks effectively. Built using React with Tailwind CSS for styling, this application enables users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on priority and completion status. Tasks are stored in local storage to persist between sessions, ensuring users donâ€™t lose their data on page refresh.
